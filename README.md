DarkIce Mobile Exercise 

Dark Ice Interactive mobile developer coding exercise

Hours Worked on: 6 hours

Most of my decision was based on what was taught and attempts at ensuring most of the data handling was object oriented and dynamic as possible while trying to keep it simple as possible. 

Using async was to ensure code were to run at the apropriate time.

Methods in the ViewModel were broken up to be self explanatory as possbile.

Service choice was based on comfortability and understnding of the package I used previously filters were applied here so only the necessary information was passed onto the app.

With the attempt at making my code more inlined with OOP it make testing more easier to attempt.

ListView was used since primary data was not complex, with the addtion of being able to add a context tap for the development to move into the bonus round of navigating to a page based.
